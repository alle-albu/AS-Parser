DT ASSIGNMENT 1.5

 UART_3 interface of the microcontroller needs to be configured with
the following parameters: 
  - a BAUD rate of 115200 bps, 
  - 1 STOP bit, 8 bits per character,
  - no parity and buffered mode enabled. 
  
The main function, that needs to be studied for
accomplishing the configuration of UART_3, is -> DRV_UART_Configure. <-

- For autobaud: an -> AT<CR><LF> <- sequence need to be sent to the modem prior of any other
communication. It is advisable to send this sequence several times with a temporization
of 1 second to insure the modem performs the AUTOBAUD. Sending 3 of this sequence
may suffice. 
.....
const char at_command_simple="AT\r\n"
...
int main(void)
{
 ...
 DRV_UART_Write(UART_3, at_command_simple, strlen(at_command_simple);
 TIMER_SOFTWARE_Wait(1000);
 ...
}



- Actual communication: Only after sending these sequences we can begin ”talking” to the GSM modem. As
stated above, considering a TOP-DOWN design method the first level, in our case, could
be the infinite loop performing the signal request and print once per second on the debug
terminal.
.....
AT_COMMAND_DATA data_structure;
const char at_command_simple="AT\r\n"
const char at_command_csq = "AT+CSQ\r\n"
timer_software_handler_t my_timer_handler;
...
int main(void)
{
 ...
 uint32_t rssi_value_asu;
 uint32_t rssi_value_dbmw;
 ...
 while (1)
 {
 if (TIMER_SOFTWARE_interrupt_pending(my_timer_handler))
 {
 ExecuteCommand(at_command_csq);
 if (CommandResponseValid())
 {
 rssi_value_asu = ExtractData(&data_structure);
 rssi_value_dbmw = ConvertAsuToDbmw(rssi_value_asu);
 printf(...);
 }
 TIMER_SOFTWARE_clear_interrupt(my_timer_handler);
 }
 }
 ...
} 


- ExecuteCommand function:  This function has as main roles to send the command given as parameters and
to wait for a correct response. 
void ExecuteCommand(const char *command)
{
 SendCommand(command);
 GetCommandResponse(command);
} 


- SendCommand function: The SendCommand function has practically one important role which is the actual
command string send over the UART line. The only observation here is that, in order to
insure a clean buffer environment when initiating a new command, it would be best to
first flush the buffers of the serial interfaces. 
void SendCommand(const char *command)
{
 DRV_UART_FlushRX(UART_3);
 DRV_UART_FlushTX(UART_3);
 DRV_UART_Write(UART_3, command, strlen(command));
} 


- GetCommandResponse function:  Its main role is to wait for a valid response from the
GSM modem in a given period of time. A timeout mechanism using a software timer
needs to be implemented here mainly because we need to consider that the GSM modem
is not a reliable communication partner thus it may crash. In such a situation we need to
insure that our software running on the microcontroller detects this situation and does not
get into a blocking state. Giving the fact that a software timer will be used, a prior
configuration before our main infinite loop needs to be taken into consideration. Also, the
software timer handler needs either to be declared globally or sent to the
GetCommandResponse function as parameter in order to have access to it.
 Furthermore, it is very important to mention that the GetCommandResponse function
will be the one responsible in calling our previously developed library for parsing and
extracting data from the GSM modem. 
...
timer_software_handler_t my_handler;
...
void GetCommandResponse()
{
 uint8_t ch;
 BOOLEAN ready = FALSE;
 TIMER_SOFTWARE_reset_timer(my_handler);
 TIMER_SOFTWARE_start_timer(my_handler);
 while ((!TIMER_SOFTWARE_interrupt_pending(my_handler)) && (ready == FALSE))
 {
 while (DRV_UART_BytesAvailable(UART_3) > 0)
 {
 DRV_UART_ReadByte(UART_3, &ch);
 if (at_command_parser(ch) != STATE_MACHINE_NOT_READY)
 {
 ready = TRUE;
 }
 }
 }
}

- Actual ASSIGNMENT: Integrate the AT command parser library developed and tested in
the previous laboratory work into the basic Keil project provided, having the explanations
in this laboratory work as a starting point. It is mandatory that the AT command parser
library should not be copy-pasted into the main.c file but added as separated files (a .c and
.h) in the main folder of the Keil project. The outcome of the program on the
microcontroller should print the RSSI value received via the information return by the
AT+CSQ command. Search the AT command manual for the syntax and how the result
is presented. The RSSI value should be printed in both ASU units and dBmW units. The
transformation from ASU units (as AT+CSQ returns) to dBmW can be made using the
formula [13]:
݀   dBmW = 2 * ASU - 113
